            This diagnostic test is designed to measure your reading speed and
            comprehension skills across a variety of text difficulties. Hereâ€™s
            how it works:
          </p>
          <ol className="mt-2">
            <li>
              You will be presented with 5 texts, each increasing in difficulty.
            </li>
            <li>
              For each text, click "Start" to begin reading and "Done" once you
              finish. Your reading time will be recorded.
            </li>
            <li>
              After each text, you'll take a short quiz to test your
              comprehension of what you've just read.
            </li>
            <li>
              Based on your reading speed and quiz scores, we'll provide
              personalized recommendations to improve your reading skills.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>
      <ReadingTimer />
    </div>
  );
};

export default DiagnosticPage;
